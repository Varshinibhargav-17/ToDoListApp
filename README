- React Native DateTimePicker

## Setup

Need to have installed:
- Node.js
- Android Studio
- React Native CLI setup
- Firebase project with email/password auth enabled

Run it:

## What I learned building this

- Setting up React Native CLI (had some version issues but figured it out)
- Working with Firebase for the first time
- TypeScript with React Native
- Using Context API properly
- React Navigation between screens
- Date/time pickers in mobile
- Sorting algorithms with multiple criteria

## Known issues

- UI could be more polished
- No backend API yet (just using Firebase)
- Task categories/tags not implemented
- No push notifications for deadlines

## If I had more time

- Build a proper backend with Node.js and MongoDB
- Add task categories
- Notifications when deadlines approach
- Drag and drop to reorder
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Better animations
